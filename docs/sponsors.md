### Our Sponsors
- I use date picker for my app
- but I can't find the tutor in guild or api that I add a class for start-picked date and end-picked date. 
- after a day I know that I can use this pattern with select-attribute and drag-attribute
  const attrs = ref({
      highlight: {
        start : {
          class: "start-end-date",
          contentClass : "start-end-date-content",
        },
        base : {
          class: "bg-selection",
          contentClass: "content-selection",
        },
        end : {
          class: "start-end-date",
          contentClass : "start-end-date-content",
        }
      },
    });
- Hope api or guild can write more specific so user like me can code faster. 
- tks you.
